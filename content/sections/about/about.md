Hi! I'm a back-end software engineer based in Boston, MA looking to expand my knowledge of the tech stack and build cool stuff in the process. I graduated from The University of Texas at Austin with a B.S. in Computer Science and have since continued to hone my skills as a software engineer at Citrix Systems.
